            <em>2021</em> | Evaluation of Artificial Neural Network Inference

            In this paper, an accelerator for artificial neural network
            inference on edge devices, namely the Intel Neural Compute Stick
            (NCS), will be evaluated in terms of speed, energy consumption, and
            performance/cost ratio after which it will be compared to other
            similar solutions. It has been concluded that the inference speed is
            significantly better by using the Intel NCS than without it. This
            solution can be used in private projects and prototyping because of
            its low cost and low power consumption.

            The performance of these algorithms has been measured on regular as
            well as on embedded GPU hardware (using CUDA), and a significant
            speedup has been achieved. Additionally, this paper shows that a
            blocked data access results in significant energy savings of up to
            72% on embedded hardware.

            This paper presents a low-cost, single sensor autonomous mobile
            robot. The proposed system is able to mapan indoor environment,
            while at the same time localizing itselfwithin it, and solving the
            SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) problem using data
            gathered from the sensor. It is able to navigate the environment,
            choosing safe pathsfor exploration based on the data acquired by
            mapping and localization.
