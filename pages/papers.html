          <em>2025</em> | Vocalize: Lead Acquisition and User Engagement through Gamified Voice Competitions
        </h3>
        <p>
          This paper explores the prospect of creating engaging user experiences and collecting leads through an
          interactive and gamified platform. We introduce Vocalize, an end-to-end system for increasing user engagement
          and lead acquisition through gamified voice competitions. Using audio processing techniques and LLMs, we
          create engaging and interactive experiences that have the potential to reach a wide audience, foster brand
          recognition, and increase customer loyalty. We describe the system from a technical standpoint and report
          results from launching Vocalize at 4 different live events. Our user study shows that Vocalize is capable of
          generating significant user engagement, which shows potential for gamified audio campaigns in marketing and
          similar verticals.

          <em>2021</em> | Evaluation of Artificial Neural Network Inference
          Speed and Energy Consumption on Embedded Systems
        </h3>
        <p>
          In this paper, an accelerator for artificial neural network
          inference on edge devices, namely the Intel Neural Compute Stick
          (NCS), will be evaluated in terms of speed, energy consumption, and
          performance/cost ratio after which it will be compared to other
          similar solutions. It has been concluded that the inference speed is
          significantly better by using the Intel NCS than without it. This
          solution can be used in private projects and prototyping because of
          its low cost and low power consumption.

          <em>2020</em> | Comparison of the Non-Blocked and Blocked
          Floyd-Warshall Algorithm with Regard to Speedup and Energy Saving on
          an Embedded GPU
        </h3>
        <p>
          The performance of these algorithms has been measured on regular as
          well as on embedded GPU hardware (using CUDA), and a significant
          speedup has been achieved. Additionally, this paper shows that a
          blocked data access results in significant energy savings of up to
          72% on embedded hardware.

          <em>2020</em> | Low cost UGV platform for autonomous 2D navigation
          and map-building based on a single sensory input
        </h3>
        <p>
          This paper presents a low-cost, single sensor autonomous mobile
          robot. The proposed system is able to map an indoor environment,
          while at the same time localizing itself within it, and solving the
          SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) problem using data
          gathered from the sensor. It is able to navigate the environment,
          choosing safe paths for exploration based on the data acquired by
          mapping and localization.
