*I solve practical problems.*

---

Mostly, I am interested in programming for the sake of **optimization**. 

Currently, I am working as a **Software Engineer** with a focus on **AI**, **system design**, and **internal tooling/DevEx**. I have published several papers, and worked with students as a GTA.

Big fan of **Sci-Fi** and **retro gaming**.
