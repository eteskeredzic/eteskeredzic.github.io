<h1 align=center> C/C++ Optimizations </h1>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: bold;">
Always avoid jumps and branches;<br><br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
If possible, use switch/case whenever applicable. The compiler will (sometimes) optimize it to a lookup table. If you are forced to use if/else statements, put the most common ones first;
</li>
<li>
When calling a function, two jumps are performed;
</li>
<li>
Iteration is always better than recursion;
</li>
<li>
Never write short functions, either write the code directly, or use inline functions;
</li>
<li>
Avoid calling functions inside loops. Instead, call loops inside of functions.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: bold;">
Consider how arrays are stored in memory;<br><br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
N-dimensional (N > 1) arrays  are always stored as 1D arrays in memory;
</li>
<li>
When accessing data, try to do it sequentially (simulate the way it is stored in memory);
</li>
<li>
Data is always fetched into cache in blocks. That means that, if you accessed arr[i][j], then arr[i][j+1] is probably already cached - you do not have the same guarantee for arr[i+1][j].<br><br>
</li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: bold;">
Avoid local variables;<br><br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
If your function only has a few local variables, the compiler can optimize those to be stored on the stack.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: bold;">
Use shifting instead of multiplication and division;<br><br>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
Shifting left by N bits gives the same result as multiplying by 2^N;
</li>
<li>
Shifting right by N bits gives the same result as dividing by 2^N.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: bold;">
Consider using table lookups if doing GPU or FPGA Programming;<br><br>
</li>

<li style="font-weight: bold;">
Be mindful of the operators you use;<br><br>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
For simple data types, always use +, -, *, / instead of +=, -=, *=, and /=;
</li>
<li>
For objects, the oposite is true.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: bold;">
Whenever you can, use prefix operators (++x and --x) instead of postfix operators (x++ and x--);<br><br>
</li>

<li style="font-weight: bold;">
Try to simplify your math;<br><br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
For example, if you have to divide by x many times, consider calculating y = 1/x first, and then doing multiplications by y instead of divisions by x;
</li>
<li>
Avoid mathematical functions if you don't need them. Checking if a > b gives the same resul as checking if sqrt(a) > sqrt(b) - for most use cases, at least;<br><br>
</li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: bold;">
Some stuff specific to code:<br><br>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you're working in C++, consider running std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false); - this makes the cin and cout operations preform much faster;
</li>
<li>
Most compilers will optimize zero assingment (i.e. x = 0) to self-XORing (i.e. x ^= x). However, some won't, so considering doing the XORing yourself;
</li>
<li>
If the direction of a loop does not matter, consider replacing for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) with for(i = n; --i);
</li>
<li>
Printf and scanf are faster than cout and cin.
</li>
</ul>
